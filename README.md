### **General info:**
This project is an implementation of serial communication between "Ithaki" server and user's personal computer using the programming language Java. 
In fact the project, consists of 5 questions that needed to be answered for the course "Computer Networks I" of my undergraduate academic studies. Feel free to 
download and edit the code.

<br/>

### **Setup:**
Unfortunaltely only AUTH members can practically use this implementation. This is becasue of the fact that, in order to run the program, you have to include the 
correct *.jar* file within your project that it is on the following link. The problem is that you need to be AUTH student to enter the platform.<br/>

*This section will be filled with more useful info soon*.

### **Complete stuff:**
The serial communication is achieved perfectly. Everything works fine.
